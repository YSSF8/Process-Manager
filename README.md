<h3 align="center">Process Manager</h3>

Just a simple process manager app made to kill apps like the Windows task manager but with modern UI (material design) made with C#.

The app requires <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">.NET 6.0</a>.

This app faster than the default Windows Task Manager, so if you are using a low-end pc it will be useful for you.
