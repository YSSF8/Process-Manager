This app is a task manager tool for Windows that allows users to view and manage the processes running on their system. It provides detailed information about each process, including its name, process identifier (PID), and memory usage. Users can refresh the list of processes at any time, and can also end a selected process if needed. In addition, the app offers the ability to view both CPU and RAM usage, helping users to monitor the resource usage of their system. The app is built using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework and is written in the C# programming language. It is designed to run with administrator privileges, ensuring that users have the necessary access to manage processes on their system.
